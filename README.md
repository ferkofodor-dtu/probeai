Well... The original idea was to create the flow of MLOps for an existing, simple model, to learn the nuts and bolts of building a pipeline by myself. I think that I achieved, with the exception of deploying the model in the cloud. I have managed to cover most of the course material and managed to implement my project into this "new" MLOps framework. I ended up working on the classifier module of the figure above, as that is the part of the software that is "trainable" and could eventually be seen as the ML part of the project. Nevetheless, I feel that for such a simple model, maybe having such a big project structure is a bit of an overkill. I do recognized, however, also from experience, that now having all these logging modules and version control in place, it will be much easier to scale the project towards new data and new users. This course has given me a great overview of what a large-scale project could look like and how I should be thinking when I am thinking of deploying models in production.

## Project structure
Created using [mlops_template](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/mlops_template),
a [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for getting
started with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
